# SkiaPSD
Cross-platform library for loading and rendering PSD files using SkiaSharp.

This is a port inspired by the [System.Drawing.PSD](https://github.com/DsonKing/System.Drawing.PSD) library made by DsonKing. 
As DsonKing's library uses types from the Windows-only System.Drawing.Common namespace, we rewrote it on top of SkiaSharp in order to be able to render PSD images on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
